# Quickstart: React app with FusionAuth

This repository contains an Github hosted React app that works with a cloud hosted instance of FusionAuth.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/synedra/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web)

## Overview

The gitpod instance will first start up a FusionAuth application on port 9011.

Additionally, there is a React application running on port 3000, which is loaded into the right hand panel.

You can log in to the React application with 'admin@example.com', password 'password'.

You can see the logs for the FusionAuth application in the fusionauth/logs directory.

Visit https://fusionauth.io/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-javascript-react-web for a step by step guide on how to build this React app integrated with FusionAuth from scratch.
